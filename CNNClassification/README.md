# Convolutions for Classification

This repo contains 2 implementation of convolutions for classification: 
one learns embeddings from scratch and the other uses pre-trained embeddings.

1. [From scratch approach](from_scratch.ipynb) 
    - uses 1.96M parameters model.
    - was able to achive 89% test accuracy on the IMDB sentiment classification task.

2. [Pre-trained approach](pre_trained.ipynb)
    - uses 2.54M parameters model.
    - was able to achive 89% test accuracy on the IMDB sentiment classification task.
